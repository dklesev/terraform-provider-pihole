  Authentication
  The provider supports password-based authentication.
  [!WARNING]
  While you can configure the password in the `provider` block, this will result in the password being stored in plain text in the Terraform state file.**Strongly Recommended**: Do not set the `password` field in the configuration. Instead, set the `PIHOLE_PASSWORD` environment variable. This prevents the secret from being persisted in the state.
