# pihole_client (Resource)

Manages a Pi-hole client configuration.

Clients can be identified by IP address, MAC address, hostname, CIDR subnet, or interface name.

## Example Usage

### By IP Address

```hcl
resource "pihole_client" "workstation" {
  client  = "192.168.1.100"
  groups  = [pihole_group.trusted.id]
  comment = "Developer workstation"
}
```

### By MAC Address

```hcl
resource "pihole_client" "laptop" {
  client  = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
  groups  = [pihole_group.trusted.id]
  comment = "My laptop"
}
```

### By Subnet

```hcl
resource "pihole_client" "iot_subnet" {
  client  = "192.168.10.0/24"
  groups  = [pihole_group.iot.id]
  comment = "IoT devices subnet"
}
```

### By Interface

```hcl
resource "pihole_client" "guest_wifi" {
  client  = ":wlan1"
  groups  = [pihole_group.guests.id]
  comment = "Guest WiFi interface"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Manage a client by IP address
resource "pihole_client" "desktop" {
  client  = "192.168.1.100"
  comment = "Office desktop"
}

# Manage a client by MAC address
resource "pihole_client" "laptop" {
  client  = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
  comment = "Work laptop"
}

# Manage an entire subnet
resource "pihole_client" "iot_subnet" {
  client  = "192.168.10.0/24"
  groups  = [pihole_group.iot.id]
  comment = "IoT network - strict blocking"
}
```

```shell
# Import by client identifier
terraform import pihole_client.desktop 192.168.1.100
```
